I just ran into this error message:

> `$ find . -name "*/version*/*"
> find: warning: UNIX filenames usually don't contain slashes (though pathnames do). That means that '-name */version*/*' will probably evaluate to false all the time on this system. You might find the '-wholename' test more useful, or perhaps '-samefile'. Alternatively, if you are using GNU grep, you could use 'find â€¦ -print0 | grep -FzZ */version*/*'.`

I wish I could say the same about [git](http://git.or.cz/). :)
