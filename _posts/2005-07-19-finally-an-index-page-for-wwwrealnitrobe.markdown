Yesterday, I uploaded a new index page for [realnitro.be](http://www.realnitro.be/). It's a small page, just to have something that refers to this blog, to some sites I made and to my e-mail adress. (I might add my [JID](http://www.jabber.org/) too.) I don't know if the page is working in IE as it should, but I might look into that later today.

Having passed my exams in july, I have a lot of free time (three months minus some vacation work), so I'll probably be able to post some more interesting stuff on this blog for the months to come. (I might adjust [mabber.py](http://blog.eikke.com/index.php/realnitro/2005/03/18/mabber_py_1) a bit to make it work again on eduserv, and I should finish that little glade/gstreamer-experiment too some day.)
