This is just a quick note to announce that I will be reviewing "[Grok 1.0 Web Development](http://www.packtpub.com/grok-1-0-web-development/book?utm_source=blog.realnitro.be&utm_medium=bookrev&utm_content=blog&utm_campaign=mdb_002626)" from [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/). They kindly provided me with an elektronic copy of the book. I'm looking forward to getting to know a new Python web framework ([Grok](http://grok.zope.org/)) and the framework it's based on ([Zope 3](http://www.zope.org/)). To be continued...
