While I don't use this blog very often, it has been four months since my previous post, I have to clean about 10 spam messages here [i]every single day[/i]. This has been going on for a while now, and I'm sick and tired of it. So I did a little google search for anti-comment-spam plugins. It seems like [url=http://plugins.b2evolution.net/index.php?cat=26]these plugins[/url] are my only hope. [url=http://forums.b2evolution.net/viewtopic.php?t=7471]This one[/url], and this [url=http://www.village-idiot.org/archives/2005/01/28/b2evo-captcha-explained/]this one[/url] are interesting in particular. Does anybody have any experience with one of those two? Do they work?
