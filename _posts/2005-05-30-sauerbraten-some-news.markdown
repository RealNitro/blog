It's been quite a while since I posted here. So here's a little update. I'm preparing for my exams, the first one is friday. I can feel the exam stress already, which is good, because I need some stress to study. (if there is no stess, I waste my time with surfing and gaming) I've got 5 exams this semester, 3 difficult ones, and 2 easy ones (surprisingly, the easy ones are computer-related ;-) ). The 3 difficult ones come first, so after those, the worst part is over and the fun begins. :-p

Now, about that weird word '[Sauerbraten](http://strlen.com/sauerbraten/)' in the title. [Sauerbraten](http://strlen.com/sauerbraten/) is 'Cube 2'. (I have [posted about Cube before](http://blog.eikke.com/index.php?cat=35).) The first 'relatively mature' release is availiable for download [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sauerbraten/). Saurebraten runs on linux and windows. If you want to try Saurerbraten out, you should extract the .zip file somewhere on your harddrive. **Linux** users should go to _sauerbraten/sauerbraten_ and run '_sauerbraten_unix_'. (you might have to change the permissions of _sauerbraten/sauerbraten/sauerbraten_unix_ and _sauerbraten/sauerbraten/bin_unix/linux_clien_t to make sure they are executable) **Windows** users should execute _sauerbraten\sauerbraten\sauerbraten.bat_. Remember that this is an early release, so many things might still change. I think the looks have improved a lot, but some features still annoy me: I hate those stupid ogre models and the other monsters. They just don't fit in a FPS game.

Oops, my break is over. Back 2 the books. >:( Cya!
