It's been quite a while since I posted here. So here's a little update. I'm preparing for my exams, the first one is friday. I can feel the exam stress already, which is good, because I need some stress to study. (if there is no stess, I waste my time with surfing and gaming) I've got 5 exams this semester, 3 difficult ones, and 2 easy ones (surprisingly, the easy ones are computer-related ;-) ). The 3 difficult ones come first, so after those, the worst part is over and the fun begins. :-p 

Now, about that weird word '[url=http://strlen.com/sauerbraten/]Sauerbraten[/url]' in the title. [url=http://strlen.com/sauerbraten/]Sauerbraten[/url] is 'Cube 2'. (I have [url=http://blog.eikke.com/index.php?cat=35]posted about Cube before[/url].) The first 'relatively mature' release is availiable for download [url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/sauerbraten/]here[/url]. Saurebraten runs on linux and windows. If you want to try Saurerbraten out, you should extract the .zip file somewhere on your harddrive. [b]Linux[/b] users should go to [i]sauerbraten/sauerbraten[/i] and run '[i]sauerbraten_unix[/i]'. (you might have to change the permissions of [i]sauerbraten/sauerbraten/sauerbraten_unix[/i] and [i]sauerbraten/sauerbraten/bin_unix/linux_clien[/i]t to make sure they are executable) [b]Windows[/b] users should execute [i]sauerbraten\sauerbraten\sauerbraten.bat[/i]. Remember that this is an early release, so many things might still change. I think the looks have improved a lot, but some features still annoy me: I hate those stupid ogre models and the other monsters. They just don't fit in a FPS game.

Oops, my break is over. Back 2 the books. >:( Cya!
