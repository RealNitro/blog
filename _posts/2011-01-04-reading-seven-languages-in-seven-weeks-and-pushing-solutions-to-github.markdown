During the Christmas holidays I started reading [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](http://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks). That means being exposed to seven new programming languages. Why? Because they all have some aspects that make them worth discovering. [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) has some extremely agile features I wasn't familiar with. [Io](http://www.iolanguage.com/) uses prototypal inheritance and is a message passing language. [Prolog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) is a [logic programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming), a type of programming language I wasn't familiar with. Etc. I read part of the Prolog chapter using the preview functionality on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X/), and it convinced me to buy the book.

After finishing the Ruby chapter last week, I'm getting familiar with Io now. So far the book has been a great read, and I look forward to the rest of the chapters, wondering what new insights Clojure, Haskell, Prolog, Scala and Erlang will bring.

Although the book says answers to the questions and exercises are included in the final pages, they are nowhere to be found. So I decided to [push my answers to Github](https://github.com/RealNitro/Seven-Languages-in-Seven-Weeksâ€“Solutions) in case fellow readers would like to compare. I'm not sure at all that these answers are correct. They most probably will contain bugs. If you find any, just clone the repository and fix them. ;-)
