The lessons for the second semester started today. The classes in the morning were dropped, but the ones in the afternoon â€“ Electric Networks -- were terribly boring (as usual :roll: ).

I'm changing the code of [one of my sites](http://www.realnitro.be/volkstuin_test/) to XHTML atm. I'm nearly finished, but it will probably look quite f*cked up in [IE](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/). I'll reboot into windows tonight and check it out. If anyone has some feedback about the code, plz comment it, so I can learn from my mistakes. ;-) (Idd, the menu in the corner thing is similar to the one on [www.eikke.com](http://www.eikke.com/), sorry about that Ikke. :oops: )

Wheeeeee, a new episode of [RedvsBlue](http://redvsblue.com/)!
