The exams have started in a bad way. Hardly anybody had enough time to answer all questions of our first exam ('Transportverschijnselen'). Lets hope for the best.

As some people already know, I'm going to buy a PDA (or something similar) in the near future. The ones I am/was interested in are: the [Palm Lifedrive](http://www.palmone.com/us/products/mobilemanagers/lifedrive/), [Dell X30](http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx?c=be&cs=bedhs1&id=axim_x30_wireless&l=nl&s=dhs) or [X50](http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/axim_x50_520?c=be&cs=bedhs1&l=nl&s=dhs), or the (to be released) [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/770). The LifeDrive is too expensive and slow I'm afraid, and the Dell's, wellâ€¦ they use Windows :-p . So I'll probably buy that Nokia 770\. There are a few features of it that I'm worried about though:

* Will it support VPN over Wifi?
(needed to connect to our University network)

* Will it support pdf reading?

* How long will the battery last?
(the site says three hours, I know)

* Will there be linux desktop software to upload files to the 770?

* I hope there will be apps to view .ppt (powerpoint) files.

* And last, but not least: When will Nokia release it?
(the sooner the better :-p )

I still have to check out the prices for those mini memory cards the 770 uses too. Lot's of things to think about. ;-)
