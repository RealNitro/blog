Remember me introcucing [Cube](http://www.cubeengine.com/)? Check [this](http://www.gentoo.org/images/gwn/20050131_cube.png) out! More info [here](http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/02/2034248) and [here](http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20050131-newsletter.xml). Too bad I can't check it out on my pc, I hope an x86 version will be released aswell. The [article](http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20050131-newsletter.xml) in the gentoo newsletter says "a whole cluster of ODWs running Cube will be part of the presentations in the Gentoo developer room at [FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org/2005) in Brussels, 26-27 February 2005", so maybe I'll see them running there. ;-)

And now for something completely different: more gaming news! :-p The [homepage](http://www.truecombat.com/intro.php) of my favorite RTCW:ET mod has been updated. Next week the developers will release another test-version containing lots of new goodies, and maps. Those screenshots of the 'snow' map look 88| (<-this smiley should be forbidden. I bet it makes some people have an epilepsy attack or something).
