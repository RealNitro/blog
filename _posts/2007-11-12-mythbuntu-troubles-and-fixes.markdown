Last week I set up a [Mythbuntu](http://www.mythbuntu.org/) system on my desktop machine. The install went fine, but I could not get Mythtv to show any video. My system just locked up with nothing but a black screen. [This bug](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/78684) solved my problem (which was caused by my ATI radeon video-card), Mythtv no longer locks up when I try to watch tv. Next up is (re)configuring the channels.
