I'm working on a new [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org/) bot: HangBot. It should be able to let the user play small text-based games. Atm, playing Hangman (which is the game the bot is named after) and some other basic functions work. The next task on the list is making the menu-class more flexible so other games can be added easily.

The hangman game is finished (it works as it should), but I still need to find a good dictionary for the game to pick words from. 'Ikke' proposed some files in /usr/share/dict/, but those are too difficult, and they're in English (I'm looking for both English and Dutch dictionaries). If anyone knows where to find a fitting dictionary (rather short, simple words), please comment it.
