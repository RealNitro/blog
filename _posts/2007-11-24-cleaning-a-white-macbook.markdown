Over the last six months my white Macbook slowly evolved into a grey Macbook. Today I descided to clean it back to its original color. I found [this tip](http://www.freemacblog.com/how-to-clean-your-white-macbook/) about what cleaner to use, and it worked out nicely. There are only two grey areas left: those where the palm of my hand rest while typing. Even a stronger cleaning product couln't get rid of those. (No pictures, just wanted to pass that link on to other Macbook users. ;) )
