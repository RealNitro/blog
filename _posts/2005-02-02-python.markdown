Whoohoo, no more Statistics to study for at least half a year.:-D Maybe even forever, because I feel like I have a nice chance to get a B. We'll see. The next exam is Mechanics, next wednesday. It's not easy, but at least it's nog as boring as Statistics.:-p

After I read [Ikke's post](http://blog.eikke.com/index.php/ikke/2005/01/30/python_for_dummies_and_update) about using [pyGTK](http://www.pygtk.org/), [Glade](http://glade.gnome.org/) and [Python](http://www.python.org/) to create small GUI programs, I decided to learn some [Python](http://www.python.org/). I already read a [small crash course](http://www.hetland.org/python/instant-hacking.php), and I started reading the [official tuturial](http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html). Too bad I can't afford to spend a day or so to read and practice, so my progress in the tut is rather slow, but I'll get there.:-) Maybe I'll read [this tutorial](http://www.diveintopython.org/) aswell. Hopefully all that will enable me to understand [this final tutorial](http://primates.ximian.com/~sandino/python-glade/#preamble)B-)

So far I really like [Python](http://www.python.org/), I even solved some Statistic exercices with it yesterday (couldn't resist :oops: B-) :-p )

That's it for this time. bb!
